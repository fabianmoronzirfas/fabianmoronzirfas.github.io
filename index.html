<p>
  My name is Fabian Mor√≥n Zirfas and I'm a 38 year old father, cohabitee, creative technologist, lecturer, coder, tinkerer, designer, server administrator, <del>media computer science</del><sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> and Kung Fu student living in Berlin who occasionally does stuff that involves things. You can see the projects of my lectures <a href="https://interface.fh-potsdam.de/eingabe-ausgabe/">"Eingabe/Ausgabe"</a> or, <a href="https://interface.fh-potsdam.de/gestalten-in-code/">"Gestalten in Code"</a> at the University of Applied Sciences Potsdam (Germany). Snoop around in the <a href="https://github.com/ExtendScript/wiki/wiki">ExtendScript Wiki</a> while <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/extendscript-bundlr">bundling your ExtendScript</a>. There is also a lot going on with <a href="http://basiljs.ch/">Basil.js</a> right now. We are in the middle of creating version 2.0 with more goodness and less bugs. Maybe you are more into motion graphics? Then <a href="http://aescripts.com/authors/f-l/fabian-moron-zirfas/">these tools on aescripts.com</a> might be something for you. If you want to know even more checkout the <a href="{{site.url}}/teaching/">teaching</a>, <a href="{{site.url}}/work/">work</a>, <a href="{{site.url}}/education/">education</a> and <a href="{{site.url}}/projects/">project</a> pages or visit one of the social networks and ping me there.<br>
  <p><b>Update:</b> I started <a href="{{site.url}}/blog/">blogging</a> again. Let's see how long this will hold on. Also I started working at <a href="http://ixds.com/">@IXDS</a> as senior creative technologist. Awesome ü§òüèæ</p>

  <sup id="fn1">1. I stopped studying at the Beuth University. I don't feel it anymore. It takes to much time of my life for something that does not feel right. Maybe I do someday some Design Master. We will see‚Ä¶<a href="#ref1" title="No more comouter sience?">‚Ü©</a></sup>
