##Jiggity's Essays - Steve Jobs Introduces the iPhone 6 and Apple Watch
If you felt uneasy through Apple's keynote yesterday, you're not alone. Something felt off. It wasn't the features or hardware but the messaging. 

&quot;Bigger than bigger&quot; was the tagline. When you hear it, you feel the cold, impersonal march of advancing technology. There's a mechanical feel like touching a cold pane of steel. 

What we want from Apple isn't new technology. We want human warmthâ€”a possibility of living a more fulfilled, meaningful life. 

Let's review parts of the keynote that felt weak and see if Steve can make it shine.
