##Tuundra
Tuundra Reendeer is a fast and easy network and multi-core renderer for Adobe® After Effects®. No need to run custom command lines in a shell - send a composition from AE directly to Reendeer's graphical interface where you can setup it and manage the whole render queue.

Furthermore, no more sleepless night trying to configure the multiprocessing settings in After Effects for each project — Reendeer analyze each computer's cpu and memory usage while rendering and optimizes in real-time the number of frames rendered simultaneously.

Once rendered, the image can be assembled with the audio into a video file by installing the freely available FFmpeg video compressor* - you can even compress ProRes in Windows!
