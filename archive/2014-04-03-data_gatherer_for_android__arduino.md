##Data Gatherer for Android : arduino
Hello all, I though I would share with you all the new android app I have been developing it's call Data Gatherer and it exposes the sensors and data networks of an android device to an Arduino, other micro controller, PC , or just about any other device with a Bluetooth connection.
Although many of us are fluent in the Arduino's C++/processing language and IDE some may be a little off put by java and one of its IDE this is where Data Gatherer comes in. Retrieving GPS, Accelerometer, and Gyroscope sensor data is easy as setting up a serial connection.
For a full list of feature please check out the description of Data Gatherer in the play store. I will be making regular updates to the app adding new features as they are requested.
Data Gatherer does not require a rooted device.
Edit: Demo code can be found at http://ift.tt/1pZobur
Edit: Now supports image capture and image data retrieval.
Edit: A free version of data gatherer is now available. Data Gatherer
