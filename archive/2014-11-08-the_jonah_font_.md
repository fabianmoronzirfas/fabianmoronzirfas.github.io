##The Jonah Font!
A collaboration with my son. I’m often experimenting with letters at home, wondering if they’ll work on a screen. But I was surprised when Jonah told me he was going to work on a font. His penmanship is better than mine was at 12 (he’s 8). So he went to his desk with a piece of paper and came back with a fun alphabet, with some basic punctuation and numerals. I didn’t realize how well it would work in various styles until I scanned his paper and started to experiment on the computer.
