##Students mod a 3D printer to create permanent tattoos | News | Geek.com
It only took an afternoon to affix a tattoo needle to the MakerBot’s arm and get the basic positioning sorted out. A 3D printer creates objects by laying down layer upon layer of melted plastic. The same movement that extrudes plastic under normal conditions was used in this case to “build” a single layer of ink. The team chose a simple circle pattern for the tattoo, which would show off that robot’s precision.
