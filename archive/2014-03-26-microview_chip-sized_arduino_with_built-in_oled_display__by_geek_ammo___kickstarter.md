##MicroView: Chip-sized Arduino with built-in OLED Display! by Geek Ammo — Kickstarter
>The MicroView is the first chip-sized Arduino compatible that lets you see what your Arduino is thinking using a built-in OLED display.
You've never seen an Arduino™ compatible like this. With a built-in OLED (Organic Light Emitting Diode Display) you can see what your Arduino is thinking without having to connect it to your computer. 
No more cryptic &quot;Hello World&quot; LED blink sequences or shoehorning oversized displays onto your tiny Arduino™. Development is much easier when you can see what's going on.
