Tutorial - How to Give your Raspberry Pi a Static IP Address
To log in to your Raspberry Pi remotely, you'll need the IP of the Raspberry Pi – this is basically like your house address and tells the host computer where to look for it on the network. By default, the Raspberry Pi will be given an IP automatically by the router (called Dynamic IP and denoted by DHCP) when you connect to a network. However, this can change whenever you remove the Pi from the network e.g. turn it off.
 
Having a static IP isn't essential, however it will make repeated access to the Raspberry Pi via SSH much simpler, as you'll always know that the Raspberry Pi has the same address. Imagine how much trouble your postman would have if your house constantly changed location :)
 
This task assumes that you have the official Raspian OS release installed. This is available in the NOOBS distribution and can be downloaded from http://ift.tt/xCrDn0. This guide also assumes that you've connected your Pi to a network via Ethernet. If you're going to be logging into your Pi remotely for most tasks, then I recommend it's easiest and fastest to plonk it next to your router, and use ethernet to access the internet anway!
