##CamingoCode - Webfont &amp; Desktop font « MyFonts
CamingoCode is a monospaced typeface designed for source-code editors.

A compact appearance and a moderate line height provide for good legibility and make writing code a pleasure. It is based on CamingoMono, but has several specially-drawn glyphs that work well at small sizes, including Q, l, &amp;, *, ~ and #. The stroke weights are relatively light, which makes CamingoCode suitable for both bright and dark visual themes.

The family consists of four style-linked fonts (Regular, Italic, Bold and Bold Italic) and is manually hinted to give the best possible appearance on screens.
