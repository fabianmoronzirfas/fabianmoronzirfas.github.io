giCentre Utilities
A collection of utilities to assist creating data visualization sketches with Processing. 

Packages in the library include colour utilities, statistical graphics, morphing classes, spatial utilities and map projections, text input/output classes and multi-sketch tools. All are fully documented with example sketches to illustrate how to use them in your own Processing code.
