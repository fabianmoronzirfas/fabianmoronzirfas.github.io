##The iOS &quot;@@&quot; Shortcut As A Text Expander For Emails — RocketINK
&gt; Ladies and gents, I present to you the @@ shortcut. Go to Settings.app &gt; General &gt; Keyboard &gt; Shortcuts and configure them by using the following pattern:  @@ =====&gt; main email address @@@ ====&gt; secondary email address @@@@ ===&gt; third email address @@@@@ ==&gt; and so on  works great.
