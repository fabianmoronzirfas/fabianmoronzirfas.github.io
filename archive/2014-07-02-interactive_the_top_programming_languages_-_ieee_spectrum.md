##Interactive: The Top Programming Languages - IEEE Spectrum
This app ranks the popularity of dozens of programming languages. You can filter them by listing only those most relevant to particular sectors, such as web or embedded programming. Rankings are created by weighting and combining 12 metrics from 10 sources. We offer preset weightings for those interested in what's trending or most looked for by employers, or you can take complete control and create your own custom ranking by adjusting each metric's weighting yourself.
