##Computer Vision: Algorithms and Applications
Welcome to the Web site (http://ift.tt/1m5d1n3) for my computer vision textbook, which you can now purchase at a variety of locations, including Springer (SpringerLink, DOI), Amazon, and Barnes &amp; Noble. The book is also available in Chinese and Japanese (translated by Prof. Toru Tamaki).

This book is largely based on the computer vision courses that I have co-taught at the University of Washington (2008, 2005, 2001) and Stanford (2003) with Steve Seitz and David Fleet.

You are welcome to download the PDF from this Web site for personal use, but not to repost it on any other Web site. Please post a link to this URL (http://ift.tt/1m5d1n3) instead. An electronic version of this manuscript will continue to be available even after the book is published. Note, however, that while the content of the electronic and hardcopy versions are the same, the page layout (pagination) is different, since the electronic version is optimized for online reading.
