##The Computer Orchestra on Vimeo
Created by Simon de Diesbach, Jonas Lac√¥te, Laura Perrenoud Thanks to Andreas Gysin and Shiverland Productions ECAL / University of Art and Design, Lausanne Switzerland Bachelor Media & Interaction Design Computer Orchestra is a crowdsourcing platform that allows users to create and conduct their own orchestra. They can choose to upload their own music or download samples to integrate into their formation. With a simple interface, they assign the chosen samples to each post. They can also arrange detection zones, that allow them to order the "musicians" to play, using various gestures. Once their orchestra is configured, they can direct it with the movements of their body. Have a look at the full project and our new interactive studio: http://www.computer-orchestra.com www.fragment.in
