Bootstrap, from #TwitterBootstrap is a toolkit from Twitter designed to kickstart development of webapps and sites.
It includes base CSS and HTML for typography, forms, buttons, tables, grids, navigation, and more.
Nerd alert: Bootstrap is built with Less and was designed to work out of the gate with modern browsers in mind.
