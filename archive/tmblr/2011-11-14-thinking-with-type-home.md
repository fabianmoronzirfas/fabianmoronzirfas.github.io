Thinking with Type | HomeIf ThinkingwithType.com were a carton of eggs, it would be filled with those created (and sometimes illustrated) by Ellen Lupton. The egg carton would be constructed by Christopher Clark. If you wanted to extend this metaphor, you might say that the egg carton was constructed with a generous amount of help from symphony CMS and the jquery javascript library. The beautiful typography on the outside of the carton was designed by Peter Bilak and hosted by the typotheque type foundry. The egg carton was certified safe by the W3C and constructed from sturdy, lightweight, and standards-compliant XHTML and XSLT.
