Nervous System | Tools | OBJExportProcessing.org OBJExport


  This is a simple library to export surfaces from processing as OBJ files.
  It is used the same way the PDF library is used. Currently, it wonâ€™t export lines or curves, but it may in the future.
  It is still fairly untested, so expect bugs. Tested on Windows XP, OS X
  Seems to work with Trapcode Form


(excellent!)
