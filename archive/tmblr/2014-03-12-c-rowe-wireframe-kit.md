Wireframe & UI Kit
I used to approach wireframes like everyone else; boxes with labels on them. They provided limited insight or vision, and clients didn’t understand them. As a result, ideas were lost, and a gap was forming in the earliest stages of the project. What I thought were clear wireframes, were just boxes. I’m realizing that some clients need visual cues to help them interpret this bare bones approach to organizing content. But, the challenge lies in steering clear of establishing a look and feel to retain the flexibility needed in the design stages.http://ift.tt/1ca4r4V
