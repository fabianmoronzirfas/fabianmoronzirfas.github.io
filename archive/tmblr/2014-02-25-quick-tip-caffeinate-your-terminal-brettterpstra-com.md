Another random OS X command line exposé…

There’s a command called caffeinate that does exactly what the app Caffeine does — keep your computer from sleeping — but it lets you do it from scripts and the command line.

This command can be run in a couple of ways. First, you can add a timer and tell it to prevent sleep for a certain duration. Alternatively, you can attach it to another command to keep the computer awake as long as that process is running, allowing the system to sleep after the command finishes.

It handles different aspects of system sleep: display sleep, idle sleep, disk sleep and “system sleep.” It’s also handy to know that it can wake up your display through a script or SSH session.http://ift.tt/OeyHRf
