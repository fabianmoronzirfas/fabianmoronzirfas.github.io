14 World-Changing Data Visualizations, From the Last 4 Centuries
Science may be difficult, but it doesn’t have to be ugly. These images, from a new exhibit at the British Library, show how beautiful scientific data can be.

The exhibit features classic illustrations dating to 1603, including John Snow’s map of London’s SoHo that’s credited with revealing a contaminated water pump as the source of a 1854 cholera outbreak. There also are beautiful modern visualizations of data from satellites and gene sequencers. The exhibit, Beautiful Science: Picturing Data, Inspiring Insight, runs through May 26.http://ift.tt/1naQ2X4
