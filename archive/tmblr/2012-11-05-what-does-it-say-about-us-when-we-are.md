title: "What does it say about us when we are simultaneously pro-life and pro AK-47′s? What does it say about us when God’s will would allow a rapist to ask for shared
  custody and child support payments? What does it say about us when a black guy’s
  in charge and we say things like \"it’s time to take America back\"? What does it
  say about us when we think the institution of marriage is threatened by gay people
  who love each other, but not by idiotic game shows like \"The Bachelor\"? What does
  it say about us when we export democracy with Hellfire missiles, then restrict the
  right to vote here? What does it say about us when we build nuclear submarines to
  defend against exploding vests? What does it say about us when we think a guy who
  doesn’t drink, doesn’t smoke, keeps his money offshore, stubs his toe and says \"H-E-double
  hockey sticks\" and wears magical underwear can feel our pain? What does it say about
  us when we demand less government and more FEMA? What does it say about us when
  we completely forgot the colossal shit storm we were in four years ago? \n\nThe
  answer, my friends, is not blowing in the wind.\nThe answer is, \"We are fucking
  crazy."
