The ORIGINAL Illustrated Catalog Of ACME ProductsACME is a worldwide leader of many manufactured goods. From its humble beginnings providing corks and flypaper to bug collectors (“Buddy’s Bug Hunt/1935”) to its heyday in the American Southwest supplying a certain coyote, from Ultimatum Dispatchers to Batman outfits, ACME has set the standard for excellence.
For the first time ever, information and pictures of all ACME products, specialty divisions, and services featured in Warner Bros. cartoons (made by the original studio from 1935 to 1964) are gathered here, in one convenient catalog.
