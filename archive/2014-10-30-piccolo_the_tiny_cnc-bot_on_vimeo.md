##Piccolo the tiny CNC-bot on Vimeo
Piccolo is a pocket sized open source CNC-bot. Using laser-cutting, off-the-shelf hardware and Arduino, you can make your own simple 3 axis robot. Attach a brush or pen to make a quick drawing robot, or extend Piccolo with sensors, custom toolheads, or by using multiple Piccolos together. Experiment with 2D or 3D digital fabrication at a small scale! Head over to www.Piccolo.cc for all the parts and instructions to build a Piccolo of your very own.
