###fabiantheblind/pinboard-and-nodejs  
I've been unsing Pinboard a lot lately. It interested me if I could access my bookmarks from the desktop. So I started playing with two node.js pinboard modules.  
One script to get specific tags and one to post a list of links to pinboard.

Oh. wow. He accesses the [OpenPaths API](https://openpaths.cc) with [unfoldingmaps.org](http://unfoldingmaps.org). Cool. Also he reads in a table. I didn't know this exists in processing. Could be great for my [eyetracker csv reading](https://github.com/FH-Potsdam/tobii_eyetracker_csv_reading). [Forked it](https://github.com/fabiantheblind/v3gaProcessing).

###dhchoi/processing-countdowntimer
> The CountdownTimer is an easy to use library for performing timed events. It will allow the user to configure the timer's duration and interval at which tick events will occur. The timer will trigger onTickEvents after each tick interval and will eventually trigger an onFinishEvent when the whole timer duration has finished.

###fabiantheblind/IRPseudoRemote  
So you bought that shiny Apple Remote and learnd at home that your shiny MacBook Air has no IR reciever? Luckily you can build something like it yourself.  
Using a [Arduino Pro Micro](https://www.tinkersoup.de/pro-micro-a-5v-16mhz/a-1222/), a [IR receiver breakout](https://www.tinkersoup.de/ir-receiver-breakout/a-241/), both from [sparkfun.com](http://sparkfun.com) via [tinkersoup.de](http://tinkersoup.de) and this Arduino [Arduino-IRremote library](https://github.com/shirriff/Arduino-IRremote) by [shirriff](https://github.com/shirriff).

###Innouveau/FontApp  
>Normally when you are searching for a font for your design you are confronted with an endless list of fonts, alphabetically ordered. In FontApp you will find a font by specifying its appearance; you can say whether you want a Serif, Sans Serif, etc. But you can also say if you want it to be slightly lighter or wider.

###shiffman/Programming-from-A-to-Z  
>Programming-from-A-to-Z
>(or Everything you wanted to know about text but were afraid to ask.)
>(or How i learned to stop worrying and love the javascript.)
>What can computation add to human communication? Creating computer applications, instead of just using them, will give you a deeper understanding of the essential possibilities of computation. The course focuses on the fundamentals of programming the computer in the context of language and words. We'll explore topics ranging from evaluating text according to its statistical properties to the automated production of text with probabilistic methods to text visualization. Students will learn the JavaScript programming languages and develop projects that can be shared and interacted with online. The end of the semester is spent developing an idea for a final project and implementing it using computer programming.(…)
