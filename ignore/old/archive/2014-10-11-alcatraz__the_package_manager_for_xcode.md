##Alcatraz | The Package manager for Xcode
The package manager for Xcode
Alcatraz is an open-source package manager for Xcode. It lets you discover and install plugins, templates and color schemes without the need for manually cloning or copying files. It installs itself as a part of Xcode and it feels like home.
Plugins. Color Schemes. Templates.
