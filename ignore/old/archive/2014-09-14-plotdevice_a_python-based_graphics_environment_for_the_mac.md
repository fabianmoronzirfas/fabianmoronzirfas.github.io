##PlotDevice: a Python-based graphics environment for the Mac
A SCRIPTABLE GRAPHICS FACTORY
PlotDevice is a Macintosh application that lets you write Python scripts to generate 2D graphics using simple drawing commands. 
   Under the hood, your code drives the system's Quartz imaging engine, giving your scripts the same graphical power as a full-fledged Cocoa app. Your code can combine basic geometric shapes, typography, freeform Bézier curves, and a panoply of image formats. This omnivorousness makes PlotDevice ideal for both workaday tasks like image-processing as well as more exotic
uses ranging from procedural texture generation to data visualization.
