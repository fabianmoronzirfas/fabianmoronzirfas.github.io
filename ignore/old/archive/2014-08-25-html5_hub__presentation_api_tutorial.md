##HTML5 Hub | Presentation API Tutorial
Presentation API is a W3C spec draft for secondary display support for the Web. It allows a web app to present web content on a secondary display connected to the device. It would be useful for several typical usage scenarios, for example, presenting slides, sharing video and image, and playing game on a large screen TV via the mobile device.

We have implemented Presentation API as an experimental feature for Crosswalk for Android 4.2+ based on Miracast-compatible wireless display support. It is available in Crosswalk 3.32.49.0.
