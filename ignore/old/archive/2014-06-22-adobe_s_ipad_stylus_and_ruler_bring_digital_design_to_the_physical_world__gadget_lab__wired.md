##Adobe’s iPad Stylus and Ruler Bring Digital Design to the Physical World | Gadget Lab | WIRED

“We noticed that when people want to be creative, they stop using our tools and start using pen and paper,” says Michael Gough, Adobe’s vp of experience design. “From architects to graphic designers, when creative professionals first think of an idea, they usually ditch the mouse and sketch it out by hand before honing their creation digitally. It just stimulates a different part of the brain when you’re actually drawing.”
