##Bob Marley Cannabis Products | Cool Material
> You’ll soon be able to feel even closer to Bob Marley when you burn one down while listening to Exodus. Marley’s family just announced Marley Natural Fine Cannabis Products which will include some heirloom cannabis strains, including some of Bob’s favorites. The line was inspired by Bob Marley’s interest in using natural items (mostly pot) to heal and spark creativity. If you live in a state where you can buy such products, you can expect to see herb, some cannabis and hemp-infused lotions and balms, and a handful of accessories. The line launches late next year in the US.
