##RollScout™ - Go in peace! by Vivek Pandey &amp; Rinkal Thakker
Getting stuck in a bathroom with no toilet paper is frustrating. Surely you don't want to be in this situation. 

Yes, you can visually inspect the roll before using the toilet. But are we all always that vigilant? What about our guests? Especially in the urgency of 'those' moments.
RollScout™ puts an end to those annoying lapses. RollScout™ warns you when there's not enough paper on the roll through a bright and noticeable flashing light that draws your attention. So you can change the roll beforehand.
