##Linear regression - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
In statistics, linear regression is an approach for modeling the relationship between a scalar dependent variable y and one or more explanatory variables denoted X. The case of one explanatory variable is called simple linear regression. For more than one explanatory variable, the process is called multiple linear regression.[1] (This term should be distinguished from multivariate linear regression, where multiple correlated dependent variables are predicted,[citation needed] rather than a single scalar variable.)
