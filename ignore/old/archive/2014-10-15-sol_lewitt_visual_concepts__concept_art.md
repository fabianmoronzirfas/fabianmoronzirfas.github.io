##Sol LeWitt: Visual Concepts || Concept Art
In the constructivist tradition, many artists derived their works from predefined formal procedures. (Georges Vantongerloo may have been the first. in the 1950's and 1960's  it became a common practice: Ellsworth Kelly, François Morellet, Max Bill, Richard Lohse, Karl Gerstner, etc., etc.) in his 1922 "Telephone Pictures", László Moholy Nagy pioneered the idea that constructivist pieces can be specified through a set of verbal instructions, and executed by any technically capable person who understands them. In 1960's minimalism, many artists started to rely on impersonal, industrial production techniques. Constructivism and minimalism thus anticipated some important aspects of algorithmic art generation.
Sol LeWitt explicitly connects the constructivist/minimalist tradition with the algorithmic approach. He developed a rich oeuvre of minimalist drawings, paintings and sculptures, but he insisted on the conceptual nature of this work: most of his pieces were based on verbal descriptions, and these were supposed to be the "real" artworks. (Read his "Paragraphs on Conceptual Art" and "Sentences on Conceptual Art".) Note that LeWitt's descriptions are not intended (and not suitable) as autonomous artworks, to be appreciated at the abstraction level of verbal semantics. They only unleash their (often considerable) aesthetic impact when they are actually executed. They thus constitute a rather precise visual analogue of the musical scores of traditional classical composers.
LeWitt cites the proto-cinematic photo-sequences of Edweard Muybridge as his most important aesthetic reference point. His work displays a consistent interest in the idea of complete enumeration. (See our page on enumeration art.)
