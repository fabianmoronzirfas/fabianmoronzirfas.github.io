##visualizing memes : culturegraphy - culture - memes - visualization
http://ift.tt/106ug0q
Culturegraphy investigates cultural information exchange over time also known as 'memes'. These networks can provide new insights into the rich interconnections of cultural development.


Treating cultural works as nodes and influences as directed edges, the visualization of these cultural networks can provide new insights into the rich interconnections of cultural development. The graphics represent complex relationships of movie references by combining macro views summarizing 100 years of movie influences with micro views providing a close-up look at the embedding of individual movies. The macro view shows the rise of the self-referential character of postmodern cinema, while the micro level illustrates differences between individual movies, when they were referenced and by whom. The visualizations provide views that are closer to the real complexity of the relationships than aggregated views or rankings could do.
