##50 free scripts from Jeff Almasol, with a strong encouragement to donate to your favorite cause
#devforacause Jeff Almasol has graciously made a bundle of 50 After Effects scripts freely available on his website.  Please, read and heed Jeff’s request to consider donating to your favorite cause. He spends his spare time developing utilities like these to help others, and I think that it’s only fair that he ask the beneficiaries of this generosity to consider how they can be generous in return. He’d also like to hear about what scripts you find useful and what donations you’re making; use the hashtag #devforacause to let him know on Twitter. When I read Jeff’s request, I sent a donation to my favorite non-profit theater organization, since I know that I certainly have gotten a tremendous amount of value from Jeff’s work.
