##openFrameworks
openFrameworks on the Raspberry Pi
Starting with version 0.8, openFrameworks now supports ARM based devices running Linux. Similiar to the desktop-based platforms, openFrameworks provides a common interface to create applications that incorporate real-time graphics, shaders, audio/video processing and networking. openFrameworks addons (commonly referred to as ofxAddons) provide a common pathway to many popular technologies like OpenCv, OSC.

openFrameworks supports the Raspberry Pi via the recommended Linux distribution Raspbian &quot;Wheezy&quot; (hard float).
