##OpenControllers ECAL/Marc Dubois on Vimeo
Project by ECAL/Marc Dubois Tutors: Alain Bellet, Gael Hugo, Christophe Guignard, Vincent Jacquier Assistants : Karian Foehr, Matthieu Minguet, Mathieu Rivier, Sylvain Meltz ECAL / University of Art and Design, Lausanne Switzerland Bachelor Media &amp; Interaction Design Film edited by Fragment.in www.ecal.ch + http://ift.tt/17YX6gC This project suggests combining common industrial objects with several sensors that smartphones are equipped with, such as the gyroscope or the camera, in order to create controllers that are easy to reproduce: a sphere and a cube that transmit 3D movements, as well as a cone that can locate a source of light. These controllers work with a game specially developed for them. This project remains full of possibilities which I look forward to discovering. Have a look at my new interaction studio: www.fragment.in
