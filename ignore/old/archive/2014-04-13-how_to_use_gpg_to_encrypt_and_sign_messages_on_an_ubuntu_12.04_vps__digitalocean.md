##How To Use GPG to Encrypt and Sign Messages on an Ubuntu 12.04 VPS | DigitalOcean
GPG, or GNU Privacy Guard, is a public key cryptography implementation. This allows for the secure transmission of information between parties and can be used to verify that the origin of a message is genuine.

In this guide, we will discuss how GPG works and how to implement it. We will be using an Ubuntu 12.04 VPS for this demonstration, but the tools are available on any modern Linux distribution.
