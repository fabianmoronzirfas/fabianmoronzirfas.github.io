##drawn (installation) on Vimeo
(hint, kicks in around 0:40...) custom software alters a video signal in real time, creating the illusion that drawn forms come off the page. the goal is to create an organic performance of hand and ink. this was originally created as a performance, but this version is an installation for visitors to try. http://ift.tt/YAXvr6
