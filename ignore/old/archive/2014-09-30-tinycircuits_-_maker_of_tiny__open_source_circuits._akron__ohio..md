##TinyCircuits - Maker of Tiny, Open Source Circuits. Akron, Ohio.
TinyCircuits is an Open Source Hardware company specializing in designing and manufacturing very small (Tiny) electronics. Based out of Akron, OH, TinyCircuits was originally started in 2011Akron Skyline by Ken Burns as AkroSense, with the intent to develop cheap, smart (very easy to use) and tiny sensors. During development of the initial sensor prototypes, we realized the need for a host processor platform to use â€“ and the Arduino was the perfect fit. After showing off the prototypes to our friends, we began to shift our focus to building out the TinyDuino platform first, offering a core set of building blocks for makers to use to build cool stuff.
