##Aerial Bold: Kickstart the Planetary Search for Letterforms! by Benedikt Groß & Joey Lee — Kickstarter
Aerial Bold is the first map and typeface of the earth. The project is literally about "reading" the earth for letterforms, or alphabet shapes, "written" into the topology of buildings, roads, rivers, trees, and lakes. To do this, we will traverse the entire planet's worth of satellite imagery and develop the tools and methods necessary to map these features hiding in plain sight. 

The entire letterform database will be made available as a “usable” dataset for any of your art/design/science/textual projects and selected letterforms will be made into a truetype/opentype font format that can be imported to your favorite word processor.

Only with your support can we turn topography into typography and bring Aerial Bold to you!
