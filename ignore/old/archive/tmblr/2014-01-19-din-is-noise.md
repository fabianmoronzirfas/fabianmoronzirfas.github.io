DIN Is Noise is a musical instrument for Windows, Mac OS X and GNU/Linux,
Use your mouse & keyboard to make high quality music.
Live.
And improvise.

Inspired by central-asian bowed string instruments,
The Morin Khuur, the Kobyz, the Erhu, the Kamancheh, the Sarangi,
And oh the Cello.

An excellent Theremin when you arent playing right ;) 
Or play a raga of Indian classical music,
With enough Meend and Gamaks,
To bring your Guru to her knees!http://ift.tt/Ktd7FW
