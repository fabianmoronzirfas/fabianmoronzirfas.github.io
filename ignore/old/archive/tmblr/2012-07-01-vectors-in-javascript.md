Vectors in JavascriptA nice javascript vector class by reddaly.com
AE Javascript should have something like this. Or like the Processing.org PVector Class
Always creating



var path = new Array();  
path.push([x,y]);  
path.push([ab]);  
var s = new Shape();
s.verticies = path;



is complicated. Instead i would like to have all that Vector goodness like multi and sub.
