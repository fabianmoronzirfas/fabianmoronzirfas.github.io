Connecting Arduino to Processing
Introduction

So, you’ve blinked some LEDs with Arduino, and maybe you’ve even drawn some pretty pictures with Processing - what’s next? At this point you may be thinking, ‘I wonder if there’s a way to get Arduino and Processing to communicate to each other?’. Well, guess what - there is! - and this tutorial is going to show you how.

In this tutorial we will learn:

How to send data from Arduino to Processing over the serial port
How to receive data from Arduino in Processing
How to send data from Processing to Arduino
How to receive data from Processing in Arduino
How to write a serial ‘handshake’ between Arduino and Processing to control data flow
How to make a ‘Pong’ game that uses analog sensors to control the paddleshttp://ift.tt/1hTz1xu
