##Floreo: Clothing that moves using flexinol #WearableWednesday « adafruit industries blog
Floreo is meant to be an interactive experience involving technology, fashion, and design concepts. The initial goal of the project was to create a wearable and aesthetically appealing dress that incorporates the use of flexinol – a muscle memory alloy. When heated, flexinol can bend in an innumerable amount of ways. Alicia and Jerika researched, experimented, and implemented flexinol to work in accordance with fabric. Their journey is still in progress as they aspire to make their dress a reality as well as educate people on the potential uses of flexinol.
