##Colour detection in Processing on Vimeo
This is part of a Processing project I'm currently working on. This sketch allows the user to select colours from webcam input. The input is then analysed and a rectangle is drawn around all pixels close to the chosen colour. Have a look at http://ift.tt/1v10IhY for more information and source code.
