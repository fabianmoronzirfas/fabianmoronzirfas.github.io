##HPSTR Pyramid on Vimeo
This is the documentation video of the project I worked on during the &quot;Musical Interfaces&quot; course in Winter 2012/13 at FH Potsdam. The HPSTR Pyramid is an attempt to create an alternative — but native to digital world — interface, to conventional knobs and slide controls. It's an approach to have the same basic and generic functionality a knob has but to achieve it with a more natural interaction. You can find more information on how the pyramid works and the idea behind it in the full documentation (http://ift.tt/1p0geDz) Track by Samuel Emde (http://ift.tt/17e3B4A) Filmed by Franz Grünewald (http://ift.tt/1jsJnIE)
