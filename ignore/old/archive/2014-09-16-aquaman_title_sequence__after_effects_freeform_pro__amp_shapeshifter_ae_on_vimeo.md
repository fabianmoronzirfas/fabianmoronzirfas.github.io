##Aquaman Title Sequence | After Effects FreeForm Pro &amp; ShapeShifter AE on Vimeo
Aquaman animation, logo design and 3D modeling by Chris Bobotis of Mettle. Chris is a big comic book art fan. That's one of the reasons that he decided to study art, illustration and design in the first place. This updated version of the Aquaman logo draws from those lifelong passions. â€ªRumour has it that Aquaman will make an appearance in the next Batman vs. Superman movie. (with Jason Momoa of Game of Thrones as Aquaman!). This sequence was created entirely in After Effects using Mettle's FreeForm Pro and ShapeShifter AE. http://www.mettle.com
