Since I was a child I dreamed of creating animations. I loved those Saturday mornings in front of the television spending hours and hours watching cartoons. When I started studying at the <a href="http://design.fh-potsdam.de/">FHP</a> it was clear that a big focus would be creating animations. I always tried, sometimes too hard, to find a solution where I could use and improve my skills in this field. I'm still not at the end of that learning process but after 8 years fiddling with After Effects I can say I have a solid knowledge in creating graphics in motion.  
Have a look at <a href="/motiongraphics.html">my favorite moving pictures.</a>
