## Script Plugins   

Since around 2009 I've been writing scripts to automate my design workflows. Some made it to become a integral part of my <a href="{{site.url}}/work/">work</a> like the scripts for the mediaplanungonline.de which can be [found here](https://github.com/fabianmoronzirfas/mpo-id-tools). Others became products that I sell on [aescripts.com](http://aescripts.com/authors/f-l/fabiantheblind/). Below you can see some of the demo videos for the later ones.

## Frontal  

Sebastian Meier and I started to write our own presentation tool called [Frontal](http://frontal.io/) in 2015. It is a Electron based application that allows to write presentations in Markdown. Still a work in progress.   

## Basil.js  

Since this summer I started to work on [Basil.js](http://basiljs.ch/) togther with Benedikt Gro√ü, Ted Davis and  Timo Rychert. It is a creative coding framework that ports the spirit of the Processing visualization language to Adobe InDesign. We are working on fixing bugs and implement some additional features to make it more Processing like. This will also be part of my <a href="{{site.url}}/teaching/#gestalten-in-code">Gestalten in Code</a> seminar.

## Is The Lab Open?  

[interface.fh-potsdam.de/is-the-lab-open/](https://interface.fh-potsdam.de/is-the-lab-open/)  

> what  
> This site is an experiment on location based triggers. Whenever a student needs to know if the Interface Lab is open for consultation he just can load the site. It tells you if the lab is open.  

>why  
>Short version: "Because we can." Long version: "It often occurs that students ask per email if the lab is open. This is a simple way to find out. Also it is a test if location based triggers work accurate.  

>how  
>On the mobile device of the lab supervisor is a location based trigger installed with <a href="https://ifttt.com">ifttt.com</a>. If he enters the area IFTTT calls the API of the application.The sent value is cached for faster response times. According to the result of the cached data the application presents the information when the user loads the site. For further and deeper insight check out the open source <a href="https://github.com/FH-Potsdam/is-the-lab-open">code at github.com</a>
