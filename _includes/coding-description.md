you reached my coding overview. Before you dive into the projects, let me explain what programming means to me and why I spend so much time with it. I'm not a 'programmer'. I'm an autodidact that came from the design. Using processing I learnd that the computers we use have more power I could even imagine and all the repetitive tasks could be done by the machine. With this kind of 'lazieness' in mind I started automating InDesign layouts and developing tools for After Effects. But enough of that. See my favorite programming projects below.
