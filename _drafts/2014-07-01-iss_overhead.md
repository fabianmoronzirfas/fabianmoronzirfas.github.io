##ISS Overhead
The ISS Overhead is an ambient display that glows whenever the International Space Station is flying overhead.
It is designed to act as an occasional reminder that there are people living and working in space!

This project should take you somewhere between 2 hours to an afternoon to complete. It assumes you know how to solder, and are somewhat familiar with Electric Imp. If you haven't worked with Electric Imp before, I recommend you get a basic familiarity by working through Electric Imp's Getting Started Guide before completing this project.
