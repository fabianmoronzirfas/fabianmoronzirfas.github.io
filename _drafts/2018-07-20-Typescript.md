For AE-- I've used these before: https://github.com/atarabi/aftereffects.d.ts

But not actually for typescript use.

I use Visual Studio Code as my development environment, and you can get it to accept the typings without actually needing to be writing typescript. 

Means that I can write in extendscript and still have it verify that types are correct, which is handy!
