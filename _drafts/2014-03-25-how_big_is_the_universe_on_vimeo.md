##How Big Is The Universe? on Vimeo
Beakus were commissioned to create three animated films that explain key concepts about our universe, with humour helping to explain the 'almost' unexplainable! Director AmaÃ«l Isnard also designed the films. In 'How Big Is The Universe?' ROG astronomer Liz shows us the expanding nature of the Universe and how this affects the light reaching us from distant galaxies, some of which will remain forever hidden from our view.
