Kinetic Pixels
Created by Suhjin Hong, Kinetic Pixels is an installation artwork for his graduation exhibition. 24 servo motors are installed behind a white 
fomex panel controlling movements of the blocks upon it. Simple animation was coded with Processing. Real-time animated 
physics data passes through Arduino and to each servo motors, making pixel images seemingly interact with real objects. 
Created in December 2012. HCI Creative Awards (2013).
