##Summit 47 - Smooth House Build - After Effects on Vimeo
Watch out! Motion graphics just got easy. In today's Summit we'll be covering how to make any animation look high-end and professional. Learn to do all this in a fraction of the time you'd expect. I recently saw a video Seth Eckert put together (http://ift.tt/1k3TxQd) and realized a similar effect could be achieved very easily using my Motion script. So I put together this educational video going over the process/workflow of creating this smooth house build. You can find a link to the Motion script below. You do not need it to do this tutorial, but I recommend it because it's a MASSIVE timesaver. ------------------------------------------------------- I used the Mt. Mograph - Motion script for this video. This script will change how change how you animate, free you from the Graph Editor and make your keyframes absolute rockstars. Check it out!
