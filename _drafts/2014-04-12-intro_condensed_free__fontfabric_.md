##Intro Condensed Free | Fontfabric™
The Intro type system consists of 50 unique font styles and weights. The family is characterized by excellent legibility both in print and on the web, a well-finished geometric design, optimized kerning, etc. Intro is most suitable for headlines of all sizes, but it does well in a variety of text lengths as well. The font’s various styles give it the versatility necessary to meet any type of graphic design challenge — web, print, motion graphics, etc. — and make it perfect for t-shirts, posters, and logos.
