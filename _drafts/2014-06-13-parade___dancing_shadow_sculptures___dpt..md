##Parade – Dancing shadow sculptures — Dpt.
Parade – Dancing shadow sculptures
Concept
Parade is an interactive art installation designed by Dpt. and Laurent Craste for the Chromatic festival in Montreal.
Design
The installation consists in an imposing wooden cube. A lamp attached to the top of the structure dimly lights a livid and stripped scene where two porcelain vases lie on a white dresser. The lighting highlights their shadows on the wall. As soon as someone pushes the lightbulb, the shadows of the vases come to life and animate, as if by magic, to the rhythm of the swinging light source.
