##Apple Literally Brings Some Muscle To Mobile Camera Lens Design In New Patent | TechCrunch
Apple has a new patent (via AppleInsider) that describes something somewhat far-fetched sounding – an actuator for an iPhone camera lens (the part that controls autofocus) that uses artificial muscle material instead of traditional motors to change focus and aperture size. It’s not as sci-fi as it sounds: Artificial muscle material tech has recently become compatible with mass production processes, and it’s already used in haptic feedback for video game controllers.
