The idea of [Setapp](https://setapp.com/) is great. Having a subscription model for all those lovely apps and just paying 9.99$ per month is very intriguing. My problem is, for the apps that interest me the most in their catalogue I already have a license:  

- Cleanmymac (Have it, use it, love it.)
- Marked (no [Mâ†“] document is written without it)
- Gemini (from time to time I use it but not that often as I should)
- Numi (Great calculator. It is actually free.)
- Betterzip (Also way better then the built-in archiver. And also free)
- Coderunner (Well this is one of the apps I never use but I love the idea. Normally I use the iTerm)
- Base (Okay this one might come in handy when I actually start using SQLite)
- Yummy FTP (I have a license but I use Transmit)
- Manuscript
- Ulysses (I'm on Scrivener for this kind of writing. Even though I like the visual appearance of Ulysses more.)
- Taskpaper (Well this one I bought after the beta subscription of Setapp ran out.)
