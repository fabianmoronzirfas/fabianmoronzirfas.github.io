##Open Source Offsets
Open Source Offsets is a non-profit organization that will support open source contributors with full-time salaries to continue their work contributing to the commons. Open Source Offsets will be funded entirely by backers from individual people up to very large companies. We're currently finishing our legal paperworks. Stay tuned.
