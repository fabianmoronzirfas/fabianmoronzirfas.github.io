##HIBOU - Gilded ceramic radio on Vimeo
Hibou is the result of an unexpected collaboration between two craftsmen: a gilder and an electronic specialist The body of the hibou gilded ceramic radio is adorned using a fine palladium paint that has conductive properties. the metallic patterns are not only ornamental elements but play a functional role in the object. each motif matches a particular setting : on/off, volume and frequency. the graphic designs are drawn in accordance to certain technological constraints. for example, creating a figure with a long thin line allows for more accurate sound control. all three impressions are painted across the radio surface, where users can modulate each setting with a smooth interactive gesture. “This project was created by Celia Torvisco and Raphaël Pluvinage, French designers currently studying at Ensci – Les Ateliers, with the help of Maxime Loiseau, Sybille Berger and Sylvain Chassériaux. It was imagined during a workshop entitled “Craftsmanship and Modernity” in partnership with “Sèvres – Cité de la céramique” and the “Fondation Hermès ” and lead by Jean-François Dingjian and Laurent Greslin. more picture about the project here : http://ift.tt/TBz0aE
