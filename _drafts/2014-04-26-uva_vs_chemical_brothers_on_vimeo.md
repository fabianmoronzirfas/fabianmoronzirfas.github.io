##UVA vs Chemical Brothers on Vimeo
We were commissioned by the ICA as part of their 60th anniversary celebrations to produce a special one-off live collaboration with The Chemical Brothers in Trafalgar Square. The project was supported by Becks, and filmed for later transmission by Channel 4. We augmented the Chemicals’ touring set (designed by Tom Lesh, with visuals by Flat Nose George) with a constellation of powerful lights around the square, and created a set of generative, realtime graphics for the show finale – the tracks Hold Tight London and crowdpleasers Leave Home and Block Rockin’ Beats.
