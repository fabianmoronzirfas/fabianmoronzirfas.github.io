##The World in the Viking Age - The Viking Ship Museum on Vimeo
&quot;The World in the Viking Age&quot; is an interactive exhibition at the Viking Ship Museum in Roskilde - Denmark. In a dark and intimate room, the cases rise up from the floor. The eye is drawn towards artefacts that have travelled over long distances or are inspired by cultures from distant lands. A large interactive world map with a twinkling night sky interacts with each of the room's cases. With the press of a button, the travel routes of the artefacts are displayed, across continents and great oceans. In the second installation the audience can explore the sailing routes used in the viking age by interacting with a large, circular world map.
