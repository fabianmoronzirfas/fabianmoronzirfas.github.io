##Isoscope – Exploring Mobility on Vimeo
For full documentation please visit http://ift.tt/QPxqkM As we think about traffic in cities as somewhat like the pulse of the city, Isoscope is an approach to capture this rhythm with its up and downs. It's an interactive tool that creates aesthetic visuals about locations that are reachable by car in a chosen time from a chosen location. The boundaries of the reachability is shown by 24 layered organic shapes, while one layer represents one hour of the day. The output reveals many information like the traffic infrastructure, connectivity of regions and natural boundaries. Since the location to chose is not exclusive, places all over the world can be explored and compared. For the path calculation the here API was used.
