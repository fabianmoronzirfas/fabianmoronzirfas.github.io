##Uncanny valley - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
The uncanny valley is a hypothesis in the field of human aesthetics which holds that when human features look and move almost, but not exactly, like natural human beings, it causes a response of revulsion among some human observers. Examples can be found in the fields of robotics,[1] 3D computer animation,[2][3] and in medical fields such as burn reconstruction, infectious diseases, neurological conditions, and plastic surgery.[4] The &quot;valley&quot; refers to the dip in a graph of the comfort level of humans as subjects move toward a healthy, natural human likeness described in a function of a subject's aesthetic acceptability.
The term was coined by the robotics professor Masahiro Mori as Bukimi no Tani Genshō (不気味の谷現象) in 1970. The hypothesis has been linked to Ernst Jentsch's concept of the &quot;uncanny&quot; identified in a 1906 essay, &quot;On the Psychology of the Uncanny&quot;.[5][6][7] Jentsch's conception was elaborated by Sigmund Freud in a 1919 essay entitled &quot;The Uncanny&quot; (&quot;Das Unheimliche&quot;).[8]
