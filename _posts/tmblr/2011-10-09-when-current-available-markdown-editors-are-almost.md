  When current available Markdown editors are almost all for general writers, Mou is different: It’s for web developers. Syntax highlighting, live preview, fullscreen mode, auto save, powerful actions, auto pair, incremental search, custom themes, HTML export, enhanced CJK characters support. I know, it’s exactly the app you want. (…)

  Mou is currently in early beta stage, which means there’s a lot room to add new features if I keep working on it. If you like this app, donate to help keep development going!

  Note: All the people who donated during beta will receive a license for free when Mou 1.0 released.
