title: It only takes a single millisecond for the robot to recognize what shape your
  hand is in, and just a few more for it to make the shape that beats you, but it
  all happens so fast that it’s more or less impossible to tell that the robot is
  waiting until you commit yourself before it makes its move, allowing it to win 100%
  of the time.
