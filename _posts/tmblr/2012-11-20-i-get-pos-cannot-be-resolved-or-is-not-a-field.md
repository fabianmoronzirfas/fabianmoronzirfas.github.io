Hi,
hm can you give me some more info.
- What system are you on?
- Which AE Version?
- What have you been doing?
- Did you allow the script to read and write to disk in your settings?
It would be good if we handle the support via the aescripts forums http://aescripts.com/forums/discussion/276/swissd#Item_1
