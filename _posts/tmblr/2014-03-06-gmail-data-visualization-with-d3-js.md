> Google now allows gmail users to download a complete archive of their Google Services from Google Takeout. I downloaded a copy of my gmail account and decided to poke around a bit. Iâ€™ve always enjoyed manipulating large amounts textual data with the old school UNIX commands, `sed`, `awk`, `cut`, `grep`, etc. so this sounded like a good excuse to have some fun.  http://ift.tt/1c1BTKJ
