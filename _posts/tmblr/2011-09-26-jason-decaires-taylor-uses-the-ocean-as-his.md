title: 'Jason deCaires Taylor uses the ocean as his gallery, and marine life as his
  collaborator. The 36-year-old artist grew up around the ocean, especially the teeming
  reefs off Malaysia. After getting an art degree in London, he made his way to the
  Caribbean, where in 2006 he created a pioneering underwater sculpture park off the
  island of Grenada. His sculptures serve multiple roles: They provide underwater
  habitat for marine life (including sponges and corals that serve as de facto collaborators)
  and lure away recreational divers from more fragile natural reefs. And they incite
  awe among those who visit.'
