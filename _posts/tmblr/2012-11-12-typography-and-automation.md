This is the documentation for the FH-Potsdam ;-⟩ project week “Typography & Automation”. The goal was to learn the basics of JavaScript for Adobe applications to apply this in automated layouts and generative art. Bring raw text into shape by rules. The project begun with an introduction to JavaScript and how it works with InDesign, then project and idea development to follow in individual and group meetings. At the end the contributors held a short presentation. For further info on how to write JavaScript for Adobe, have a look into the wiki, but first you should browse the projects below.
