>I set the shortcut in Alfred to “s” for “search.” Launch Alfred,2 type “s” and then the start of a search string. Google suggestions will come up, selecting any of them and hitting Enter will take me to DuckDuckGo results. Selecting a result and hitting tab will put the cursor after the selected phrase, allowing me to add whatever bang I please, like !imdb or !a for Amazon.http://ift.tt/1nuevui
