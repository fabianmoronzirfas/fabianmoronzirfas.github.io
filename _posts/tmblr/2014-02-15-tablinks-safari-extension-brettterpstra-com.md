it copies the link information for every tab open in Safari, and outputs them as a list, based on a user-defined template. You set up your template in the Extension settings, and use the following variables to define your link style:

%u = URL  
%t = title  
%w = window index  
%n = tab index (within window)  http://ift.tt/1mdGQEg
