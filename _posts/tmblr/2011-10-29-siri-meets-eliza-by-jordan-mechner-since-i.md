  Siri Meets Eliza by Jordan Mechner

  Since I (Jordan Mechner) got my iPhone 4S, I’ve been intrigued, fascinated and alarmed by Siri’s fast-growing capabilities. I thought it would make sense to introduce her to my psychotherapist, Eliza.
  ELIZA was one of the first (and longest) BASIC programs I typed into my then brand-new 16K Apple II in 1979. Originally created at MIT by Joseph Weizenbaum in 1966, this pioneering natural-language-processing simulation of a Rogerian psychotherapist impressed my family and friends every bit as much as Siri does now. I was curious to see how they would get along.
  Here is a transcript of their first encounter. Despite their 45-year age difference and two-million-fold disparity in RAM, I thought they understood each other remarkably well.
  ELIZA
  Hello, I am Eliza.
  SIRI
  Hi.
  ELIZA
  How are you today? What would you like to discuss?
  SIRI
  I’m fine. Thanks for asking.
  ELIZA
  How long have you been fine. Thanks for asking?
  SIRI
  Hmm… Let me think…
  ELIZA
  Do you doubt you?
  SIRI
  I found three hotels matching “W” fairly close to you.
  ELIZA
  Oh…?
