  Researchers Release Attack Tool That Cripples Secure Websites

  By Kim Zetter
  Researchers have released an attack tool that makes it trivial for anyone to take down websites that allow users to connect via secure connections. Unlike most denial-of-service attacks (DoS) that require an attacker to direct a network of distributed computers to take down a website by flooding it with fake traffic, the so-called THC-SSL-DOS tool purportedly allows an attacker to achieve the same result from a single computer — or in the case of a website with a number of webservers, just a handful of computers would be sufficient. The tool, released by a group called The Hackers Choice, exploits a known flaw in the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol by overwhelming the system with secure connection requests, which quickly consume server resources. SSL is what’s used by banks, online e-mail providers and others to secure communications between the website and the user.(…)
