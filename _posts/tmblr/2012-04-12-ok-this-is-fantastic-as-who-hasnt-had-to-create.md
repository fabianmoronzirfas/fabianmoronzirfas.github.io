title: Ok, this is fantastic as who hasn’t had to create maps over and over again
  or reuse ones from past projects over and over again. Now there is AEMap from Fabian
  Morón Zirfas that creates mercator projection maps with 286 separate countries that
  are after effects masks on solid layers, with just under 177 jurisdictions (pre-comps).
  How cool is that!?
