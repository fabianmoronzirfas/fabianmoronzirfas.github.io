>Reordering lines
>In the past, Iâ€™ve occasionally found myself copying lines of text into a spreadsheet program to sort them. Sublime has this covered, though, with several simple sorting algorithms.
>To perform a simple alpha sort, select the lines to be sorted and hit F5. This option ignores capitalization. Hitting Control F5 will sort lines starting with capital letters first, then alphabetize lines starting with lowercase letters.http://ift.tt/LgUsJn
