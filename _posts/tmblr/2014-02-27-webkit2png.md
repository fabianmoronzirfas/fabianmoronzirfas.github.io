webkit2png is a command line tool that creates screenshots of webpages:

With tall or wide pages that would normally require scrolling, it takes screenshots of the whole webpage, not just the area that would be visible in a browser window.
webkit2png makes use of WebKit, the rendering engine used in Safari.http://ift.tt/GQqdYM
