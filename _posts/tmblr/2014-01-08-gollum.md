Gollum is a simple wiki system built on top of Git that powers GitHub Wikis.

Gollum wikis are simply Git repositories that adhere to a specific format. Gollum pages may be written in a variety of formats and can be edited in a number of ways depending on your needs. You can edit your wiki locally:

- With your favorite text editor or IDE (changes will be visible after committing).
- With the built-in web interface.
- With the Gollum Ruby API.  

Gollum follows the rules of Semantic Versioning and uses TomDoc for inline documentation.http://ift.tt/13bN61E
