Whether you’re just getting started or have been building applications on the GitHub API for years, the GitHub Developer Program is all about making sure you have the right resources to build the best possible integrations for our incredible community.

Providing developers with a great API has always been an important part of GitHub. Over time, the API we’ve offered has evolved – adding increased flexibility, greater capabilities, and more endpoints. Launching the Developer Program today represents the next chapter in this story.http://ift.tt/P4QR8B
