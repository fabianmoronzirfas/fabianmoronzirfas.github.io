  MIT Developing DIY 3D-Printable Robots:

  The Massachusetts Institute of Technology today announced a five-year research initiative to let people design personalized robots and have them made with three-dimensional printers.
  The ambitious project envisions a day where individuals choose from a set of templates to create a robot to solve a specific task, be it playing with a pet or measuring radon levels in a basement. It is funded by a $10 million National Science Foundation grant and includes the University of Pennsylvania and Harvard University.
  “This is taking the app store to the next level,” said MIT professor Daniela Rus. “To get the device, you push a button and return to the (printing) store later to pick it up. And the device would come with a customized programming environment.”
