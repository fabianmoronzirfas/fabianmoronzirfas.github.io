  CS 6 announced, plus new tools and tutorials Here’s another summary of the last few weeks or so of news on After Effects— this time CS6 dominates, but there were still new scripts and a plug-in, and assorted tutorials. AEMap from AE Scripts “creates equirectangular projection maps with 286 separate countries (masks on solids) under 177 jurisdictions (pre-comps). It comes with the ‘AEMap Utilities’ which contains tools for dealing with a bunch of layers and nested comps.” The elements are “continuously rasterized” so they may work in CS6 extrusion and ray-tracing.
