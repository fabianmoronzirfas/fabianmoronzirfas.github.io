<p>March 05, 2014 at 01:27PM Operator Overloading with ExtendScript May 25, 2010 | Tips | EN Operator overloading in JavaScript is a controversial issue. Actually, this dangerous feature has been rejected in ECMAScriptÂ 4. However, ExtendScript allows you to override the behavior of many mathematical and logical operators on a class-by-class basis since CS2.</p>

<p>As a general rule, operator overloading should not be considered as a good programming practice. This feature is overlooked by the JS ExtendScript developers because the situations in which they really benefit from redefining an operator are infrequent and unstable. In most cases, it is far better to explicitly create and invoke the underlying operations through normal object methods.http://ift.tt/1kZHalQ</p>
