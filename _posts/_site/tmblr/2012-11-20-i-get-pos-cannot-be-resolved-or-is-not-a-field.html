<p>Hi, hm can you give me some more info.</p>

<ul>
<li>What system are you on?</li>

<li>Which AE Version?</li>

<li>What have you been doing?</li>

<li>Did you allow the script to read and write to disk in your settings? It would be good if we handle the support via the aescripts forums http://aescripts.com/forums/discussion/276/swissd#Item_1</li>
</ul>
