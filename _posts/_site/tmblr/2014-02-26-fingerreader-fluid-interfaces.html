<p>February 21, 2014 at 09:57AM FINGERREADER A WEARABLE INTERFACE FOR READING ON-THE-GO The FingerReader is a wearable device that assists in reading printed text. It is a tool both for visually impaired people that require help with accessing printed text, as well as an aid for language translation. Wearers scan a text line with their finger and receive an audio feedback of the words and a haptic feedback of the layout: start and end of line, new line, and other cues. The FingerReader algorithm knows to detect and give feedback when the user veers away from the baseline of the text, and helps them maintain a straight scanning motion within the line.http://ift.tt/1gYgXlb</p>
