<p>March 10, 2014 at 09:02AM Physical Computing Library at University of the Arts Bremen Hello dear tinkerer, this library offers a collection of articles about various electronic components such as sensors and actuators. The idea is to allow both beginners and advanced learners to find oneâ€™s way. Below you find several topics that might catch your attention. They will redirect you to a specific component which gives you a good starting point to that particular issue. If you are looking for a specific component try to use the search field. Typing in a component id will directly bring up its article.http://ift.tt/1cIkg31</p>
