<p>Vectors in JavascriptA nice javascript vector class by reddaly.com AE Javascript should have something like this. Or like the Processing.org PVector Class Always creating</p>

<p>var path = new Array();<br />path.push([x,y]);<br />path.push([ab]);<br />var s = new Shape(); s.verticies = path;</p>

<p>is complicated. Instead i would like to have all that Vector goodness like multi and sub.</p>
