<p>Found an awesome library for easily creating meshes. All you have to do is pass their triangulate method an ArrayList of PVector objects, and you get an ArrayList of Triangle objects back (The Triangle class if part of the library. It simply holds three public PVector fields representing the vertices of the triangle). Check it out at: http://wiki.processing.org/w/Triangulation [library download link is at the bottom]</p>

<p>cool. could get useful with this obj lib</p>
