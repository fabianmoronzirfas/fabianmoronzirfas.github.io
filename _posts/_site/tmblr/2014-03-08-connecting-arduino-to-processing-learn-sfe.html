<p>March 02, 2014 at 06:56PM Connecting Arduino to Processing Introduction</p>

<p>So, you’ve blinked some LEDs with Arduino, and maybe you’ve even drawn some pretty pictures with Processing - what’s next? At this point you may be thinking, ‘I wonder if there’s a way to get Arduino and Processing to communicate to each other?’. Well, guess what - there is! - and this tutorial is going to show you how.</p>

<p>In this tutorial we will learn:</p>

<p>How to send data from Arduino to Processing over the serial port How to receive data from Arduino in Processing How to send data from Processing to Arduino How to receive data from Processing in Arduino How to write a serial ‘handshake’ between Arduino and Processing to control data flow How to make a ‘Pong’ game that uses analog sensors to control the paddleshttp://ift.tt/1hTz1xu</p>
