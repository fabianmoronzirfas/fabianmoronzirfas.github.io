<p>In a strange twist fabiantheblind software has build an OBJ exporter for After Effects in a world where it seems that everyone is trying to import 3d data lately, the OBJ Vertex Exporter actually takes After Effects layer positions and exports those out to a 3D OBJ file which can then be used in your favorite 3D applicationâ€¦ including After Effects for a complete inception type loop.</p>

<p>hehe :) me likes that.</p>
