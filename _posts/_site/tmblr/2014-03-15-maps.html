<p>I’ve been collaborating with Mike Bostock on some new map projections for D3. Interrupted Maps In some ways, all 2D maps of Earth are interrupted at some point, even if it’s just along the antimeridian at 180°. Interruptions are often in areas of less interest e.g. oceans for a land-focused map. http://ift.tt/1g0hcK6</p>
