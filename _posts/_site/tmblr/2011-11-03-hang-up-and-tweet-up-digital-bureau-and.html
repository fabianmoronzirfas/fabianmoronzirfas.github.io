<p>Hang UP and tweet!</p>

<p>UP digital Bureau and Unteleported tech agency proudly present the world’s first analogue Twitter client — Tweephone. Tweephone is a joint project of two friendly digital firms. As the first anniversary of UP Digital Bureau was approaching, Unteleported tech agency had decided to present their friends with an execution of the UP’s geeky, yet interesting and challenging idea. As a result, now anyone can post to Twitter from an old-school phone you can possibly find only at your granny’s. Text dialing is based on the same principle you can find in your old cell phones. For instance, to get «a» you have to dial «2» once, and to get «f» you dial «3» three times. To send the tweet you just have to simply hang up the phone. All tweets dialed on Tweephone are posted on its personal twitter account, and if you ever get a chance to try this device, you will definitely understand why they are mostly so short.(…)—Unteleported</p>
