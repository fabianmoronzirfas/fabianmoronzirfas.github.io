<p>A dream is coming true. 3D Shapes in AECS 6. The need to learn a 3D software is getting smaller for me. Don’t get me wrong. We need 3D artists but for me it is great to have these new features in AE so I don’t need to dig myself into a 3D application. Even with their limitations. I’d love to take half a year of and learn some basics but who is going to pay all those cookies I eat? I always had the need for simple shapes with depth and since .obj came to TC Form it was bugging me. (I even tried to write .obj files from Illustrator, but something is not working right with the line endings and encoding of the written file.) At least the simple shapes are out of the way and the .obj creation can also be done with this processing lib. Yes for me it is easier creating 3D in processing than in C4D or blender. Makes me think…</p>

<p>But what about physical interaction - you say? There is newton. It does a fine job. Yeah I know all those three-dee-guys will shout: “Man - the renderer does the SHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH…” and than they use strange words I don’t understand and my brain produces some pink noise.</p>
