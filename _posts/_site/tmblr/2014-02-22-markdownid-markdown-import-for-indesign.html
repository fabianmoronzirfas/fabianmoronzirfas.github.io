<p>February 19, 2014 at 02:48PM markdownID: Markdown import for InDesign</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you want to write simple documents using a plain text editor but still want to add basic text formatting, you can use Markdown: John Gruber’s formatting system, with which you use short and easy-to-remember codes to mark up your text. Lots of websites and blogs are already using Markdown, so you can enter plain text and still have it formatted the way you want. With my Javascript markdownID (download), you can select existing text or import a Markdown file, and it will be converted into properly styled text for InDesign.</p>

<p>The script supports lots of the standard functions from the original Markdown, and so you can use the Markdown reference for the basic set of commands. Unfortunately, there are also some functions that InDesign cannot easily emulate.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Markdown was designed to work with HTML, and HTML allows unlimited nesting of its equivalent of ‘paragraph’ and ‘character’ styles – you can use a header inside a block quote and italics inside a hyperlink. However, since these codes are converted into InDesign Paragraph and Character Styles, you cannot nest them as InDesign can’t do something similar. Markdown also lets you insert images; my script does not support this. With the real Markdown you can type “inline HTML” – any HTML command is copied verbatim into its output, as it was designed to work with HTML only. Writing a full HTML-to-InDesign parser goes a bit beyond the intention of this script, so I left that out in its entirety.http://ift.tt/14MCreG</p>
