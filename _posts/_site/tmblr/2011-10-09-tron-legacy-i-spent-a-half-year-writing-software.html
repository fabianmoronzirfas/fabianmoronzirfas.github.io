<p>Tron Legacy I spent a half year writing software art to generate special effects for Tron Legacy, working at Digital Domain with Bradley “GMUNK” Munkowitz, Jake Sargeant, and David “dlew” Lewandowski. This page has taken a long time to be published because I’ve had to await clearance. A lot of my team’s work was done using Adobe software and Cinema 4D. The rest of it got written in C using OpenFrameworks and wxWidgets, the way I’ve always done it with this team ;) Uniquely however, Digital Domain’s CG artists were able to port my apps over to Houdini for further evolution and better rendering than OpenGL could ever provide. Special thanks to Andy King for showing me that what seasoned CG artists do at DD is actually not so far off from what’s going on in the Processing community.—jtnimoy: The Work of Josh Nimoy</p>
