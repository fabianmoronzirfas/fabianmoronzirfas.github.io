<p>Capitalism Works For Me! True/False | Steve Lambert</p>

<p>ABOUT THE PROJECT (from the SPACES catalog) Starting a conversation about Capitalism is like walking up to a stranger and asking, “Can I talk to you about Jesus?”</p>

<p>The word “capitalism” is a red flag. And for good reason—pretty soon either some dude is talking your ear off about “The System” or agressively confronting you about taxes. Ugh.</p>

<p>At the same time, capitalism is discussed every day using euphemisms like “jobs,” “job creation,” “the business climate,” and discussing whatever “crisis” is deemed relevant; a housing crisis, financial crisis, social security crisis, tax crisis, or fill- in-the blank crisis. But the whole is rarely a topic of frank discussion—much less alternatives or meaningful reform.</p>

<p>As a culture, we need the vision and boldness it takes to discuss the problem itself. The idea that “there is no alternative” to the way our world works takes away our ability to dream. As citizens we need the courage to begin these discussions on order to move on to new and better visions for the future.</p>

<p>But what to do? Start a conversation about capitalism and friends edge away slowly, and strangers even faster.</p>

<p>This is what art is for. This is what art does well. It creates a space where new ideas and perspectives can be explored. A space unlike any other.(…)</p>
