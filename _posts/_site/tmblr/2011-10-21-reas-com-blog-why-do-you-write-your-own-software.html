<p>@sansumbrella (David Wicks) writing is the most direct interface for describing systems and interactions.</p>

<p>@peregrintook code is a medium; many tools constrain you to narrow subgenres. Knowing the fabric and pigments of the medium permits exploring more.</p>

<p>@voxels (Michael Edgcumbe) so I can understand why the choices underlying the design seem like the most elegant solution</p>

<p>@barrythrew (Barry Threw) Because the tools don’t exist to accomplish what I want to do. There is nothing more I would like than not to have to write software.</p>

<p>@robmyers (Rob Myers) to learn, to gain understanding, to not be limited by affordances, and to be able to share all of this</p>

<p>@simonski (Simon Gauld) why? because programming is a creative expression itself</p>

<p>@vormplus (Jan Vantomme) because it’s easier to iterate through ideas and compositions. “Industry standard” tools don’t allow me to do this.</p>

<p>@brainSteen (Christopher Warnow) When code goes through my hands, it has my gesture in it. Else it would be like painting with another cold dead hand holding a brush.</p>

<p>@eskimobloood (Andreas Köberle) With other peoples software I can replicate other peoples dreams, with my own software I can dream my own.</p>

<p>@manovich (Lev Manovich) Because writing software is a form of thinking and making theory; its a big part of cultural analytics strategy</p>

<p>@AlexKarasev (Alex Karasev) Somebody has to write those tools! Not me; I just write “glue pieces” filling the functionality gaps. Some folks write to stay current</p>

<p>@miskaknapek (Miska Knapek) 1. it’s much more fun 2. existing software doesn’t conform to my way of working/desires 3. i want to be free :)</p>

<p>@admsyn (Adam Carlucci) I use existing tools to make things that don’t exist yet (or I hope they don’t, anyway)</p>

<p>@madronalabs Why do you write rather than just reading words other people have written?</p>

<p>@lankybutmacho That’s the beauty of Processing for me: coding as exploration/research. Also, then the product can be concise &amp; elegant without bloat.</p>

<p>@lennyjpg (Leander Herzog) adobe is a cheeseburger, processing is like crack. it should have a warning on it. i gave it my hand and it ate my arm.</p>
