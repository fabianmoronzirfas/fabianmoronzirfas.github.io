<p>Nervous System | Tools | OBJExportProcessing.org OBJExport</p>

<p>This is a simple library to export surfaces from processing as OBJ files. It is used the same way the PDF library is used. Currently, it wonâ€™t export lines or curves, but it may in the future. It is still fairly untested, so expect bugs. Tested on Windows XP, OS X Seems to work with Trapcode Form</p>

<p>(excellent!)</p>
