<p>December 03, 2013 at 11:19AM I certainly did not know this feature existed in OS X, but here it is: there is an easy way to take screenshots without those well-known border shadows. The screenshot of the new Maps app in OS X Mavericks was taken that way.</p>

<p>To do that, press ⌘ + shift + 4 and select the window you want to take a screenshot of by hovering the cursor above it, then press ⌥ and space at the same time. That’s it!http://ift.tt/18j7uA8</p>
