### Full time lecturer and lab supervisor  

Since September 2015 im fully employed as research assistant at the FH Potsdam (University of Applied Sciences Potsdam (Germany)). I still do now and then some freelance work but most of my time goes into teaching "Physical Computing" and "Creative Coding".  


### Part Time Lab Supervisor

From September 2013 till September 2015 I've been part time employed (first 50% then 75%) as lab supervisor at the FH Potsdam (University of Applied Sciences Potsdam (Germany)). There I started to dive deeper into "Physical Computing", server administration, "Creative Coding" and teaching. Starting from the winter semester 2014/2015 I started to teach in the basics module a full 10 credit point seminar and gave several workshops besides that.  

### Freelancer  
_(since 2008)_  
Besides the cooperations with Grenzfarben & Forseesense I work as a freelance designer and programmer. I'm involved in the development of [youstar.io](http://www.youstar.io/) and I sell script plugins for Adobe After Effects on [aescripts.com](http://aescripts.com/authors/f-l/fabiantheblind/). From time to time I get hired for some programming work or motion graphics.  

### Forseesense & Grenzfarben
_(since 2008)_  
While working for Mazooka was fun it still was a lot of work in sales. I decided to move on and had the luck to meet the Sebastian Matthäus and join the [Grenzfarben](http://www.grenzfarben.de/) group to produce product catalouges for the retailers like JustMusic and Sound Service. It started out as a job for one catalouge end ended in a long cooperation on catalouges in layout and prepress, the integration of our own media management software ([MPO](http://mediaplanungonline.de/)) into InDesign via Scripting and several animated short movies for exhibitions like BMW Junior-Campus, Deutsches Technikmuseum and companies like Erlebniskontor GmbH.

### Mazooka  
_(2005 to 2008)_  
While studying at the University of Applied Sciences Potsdam (Germany) I worked in sales and as transfer printer for the Berlin based fashion label [Mazooka](https://www.mazooka.de/).  

### Community Service
_(2003 to 2004)_  
After my apprenticeship I did my cummunity service in the kitchen of the canteen of the Ostfalia University of Applied Sciences Wolfenbüttel (Germany).  

### No Limits  
_(1996 to 2000)_  
From around 1996 to 2000 I worked in sales the companies "No Limits". This is also where I did my "Apprenticeship as Salesman in Retail" from 2000 to 2003.
