    This was my start into visualization of location based data. Without the technical skills and support of Felix Lange I would have never learned that much.

The seminar "Tangible Maps" by Dr. Frank Heidmann and Till Nagel focussed on dynamic and interactive geo visualization methods for geospatial data analysis.
On the basis of "Modest Maps" by Tom Carden (extended by Till Nagel &amp; Stefan Thiel), we developed a concept for a geo-information system (GIS) for disaster management on multi-touch surfaces.
This expert software is intended for use in any type of disaster. Exemplary we focused on fighting forest fires.  
The program uses TUIO / OpenGL / Processing / Java / fiduciary marker and is still in a gamma phase.  
There were weather Rss feeds .kmz / .kml data, xml and cvs integrated data collected on various public platforms. for example Geocommons, www.weather.gov or activefiremaps.fs.fed.us.  
Our programming team headed by Felix Lange has mostly developed in the Eclipse IDE for Java and learned to appreciate its advantages like SVN integration. The entire Java / Processing program code is under [GNU General Public License v3](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html) and can be [found here on google](https://code.google.com/p/tm-kt/).  

My part was finding and parsing data sources, organising styling classes, filming and editing the presentation video.
