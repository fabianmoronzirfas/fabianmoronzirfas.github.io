#Hello,  
you reached my motiongraphics overview. As I mentioned before already as a child I loved cartoons and animations. When I started studying at the FHP it was clear to me that creating animations has to be a big part of my curriculum. Finally I managed to make my living from that.Working together with the group forseesense I deepened my skills with After Effects. Have look at my favorite videos below.
